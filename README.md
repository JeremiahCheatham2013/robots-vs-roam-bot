An ascii survival game made for an itch.io Game Jam.

# Game storyline
## 24 March 3707
Ground control: you need to land on this alien planet to recover the probe: Roamer IV. the location is: 013:444 \
## 12 January 3708
Ship Diagnostics: |SHIP STATE: DESTROYED| MATERIALS REQUIRED: Glass 0/10, Robotic chips 0/300| REPAIR TIME ESTIMATE: 250 SECONDS| \
\
Roamer IV: Your ship needs 300 robotic chips. The good news is: this planet is filled with robots that have robotic ships and glass in them. The bad news is: if you destroy 300 robots, the planet security sends out faster robots that could potentially destroy you, Roam-Bot. another good thing is, once your ship repair is finished, you can repair my starship and go back to Earth. Try to be quick, since I can't destroy security like you can.
